## ⚠️ WHAT'S MISSING (5%)

### **Vendor Portal Nice-to-Haves:**

1. **Vendor Branding** (store customization)
   - Logo, banner, colors
   - Store description
   - Social links

2. **File Uploads** (via Supabase Storage)
   - Logo upload
   - Product images
   - COA uploads

3. **COA Management** (dedicated system)
   - List COAs
   - Delete COAs
   - Expiration tracking

4. **Vendor Analytics** (dashboard)
   - Sales trends
   - Top products
   - Revenue charts

5. **Review Responses** (vendor replies)

   - Respond to reviews

**Impact:** These don't affect core business operations, just vendor portal UX

## 🚀 SHOULD WE BUILD THESE NOW?

### **Option A: Build Everything (100% Complete)**

**What:** Build all 5 missing features  
**Time:** 15 hours (2 days)  
**Benefit:** 100% feature parity with Flora Matrix  
**Downside:** 2 more days before deployment

**When to choose:**
- Vendors are actively asking for these features
- You want 100% parity before launch
- 2 days delay is acceptable

---

### **Option B: Deploy Now, Build Later (Recommended)**

**What:** Deploy with current 95% completion  
**Time:** 0 hours (deploy today!)  
**Benefit:** Get to production immediately  
**Downside:** Vendor portal missing some customization

**When to choose:**
- Want to go live ASAP
- Vendors haven't requested branding features
- Can add features based on real vendor feedback

**Add later when needed:**
- Vendor requests branding → Build it (2 hours)
- Vendor uploads COA → Build it (3 hours)
- Vendor wants analytics → Build it (6 hours)

---

### **Option C: Build Critical Only**

**What:** Build just COA management + file uploads  
**Time:** 5-6 hours (1 day)  
**Benefit:** COAs are important for compliance  
**Downside:** Still missing branding & analytics

**When to choose:**
- COA management is legally required
- Other features can wait
- Want to launch within 1 day
