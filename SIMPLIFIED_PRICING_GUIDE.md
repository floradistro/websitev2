# üìä Simplified Pricing System

## Philosophy: Keep It Simple

The pricing system has been simplified to eliminate confusion. **No pre-filled prices, no complex templates, no placeholders.**

---

## üéØ Three Simple Templates

### 1. **Retail Flower** (Default)
**Structure:** 1g, 3.5g, 7g, 14g, 28g

Perfect for retail flower products sold by the gram.

```
1 gram (1g)
3.5g (Eighth)
7g (Quarter)
14g (Half Oz)
28g (Ounce)
```

Vendors set their own price for each tier.

---

### 2. **Wholesale Cost Plus**
**Structure:** Simple flat rate per pound

For wholesalers who want ONE flat markup on top of cost.

Example:
- Cost: $1000/lb
- Markup: $100/lb
- Selling Price: $1100/lb

No tiers, no complexity. Just set your per-pound rate.

---

### 3. **Wholesale Tiered**
**Structure:** Customizable volume tiers

For wholesalers who want volume discounts.

Default tiers:
- Tier 1: 1-9 lbs
- Tier 2: 10+ lbs

Vendors can customize the breaks and pricing.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### For Admins (Platform)
1. Go to `/admin/pricing-tiers`
2. Use **Quick Start Templates** to create blueprints
3. Blueprints are just structure templates (empty)
4. All vendors see these blueprint options

### For Vendors
1. Go to `/vendor/pricing`
2. Select which blueprint(s) to use
3. Set YOUR OWN prices for each tier
4. Assign blueprints to products

### Wholesale Vendor Example (Flat Rate):

### Wholesale Vendor Example (Tiered):
**Uses:** Wholesale Tiered blueprint

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Migration

Run `SIMPLIFIED_PRICING_SETUP.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor to:
1. Remove old confusing blueprints
2. Create the 3 simple templates
3. Clean up the database

---

## üì± Vendor Experience

When vendors create pricing:
1. They see ONLY the structure (1g, 3.5g, etc.)
2. ALL price fields are **empty**
3. They fill in their own pricing
4. No confusion, no suggestions, no placeholders

---

## üé® UI Improvements

- Quick Start Templates for one-click blueprint creation
- Clear descriptions
- No confusing options

**Vendor UI:**
- Shows assigned pricing tiers in inventory

- Edit selling prices per tier

That's it! Simple, clean, no confusion. üéâ
