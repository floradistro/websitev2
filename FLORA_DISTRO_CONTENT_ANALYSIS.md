## üé® HOW REBRANDING WORKS

### Scenario: "Canna Boyz" uses Flora Distro content

**Step 1: Copy Default Content Structure**
```sql
INSERT INTO vendor_storefront_sections (vendor_id, page_type, section_key, content_data)
SELECT 
  'cannaboyz-vendor-id',
  page_type,
  section_key,
  content_data
FROM vendor_storefront_sections
WHERE vendor_id = 'flora-distro-id'; -- Copy Flora Distro's structure
```

**Step 2: AI Reword for Brand**
```
Hero headline: "Fresh. Fast. Fire."
  ‚Üì AI rewrites for "Canna Boyz"
  ‚Üì
"West Coast Vibes. Straight Fire."

About headline: "We're the biggest"
  ‚Üì AI rewrites
  ‚Üì
"We're the realest"

Process steps: Keep same structure, rephrase descriptions
```

**Step 3: Vendor Edits**
- Change specific text
- Upload their images
- Adjust stats to match their business

**Step 4: Template Selection**
- Flora Distro uses "Minimalist"
- Canna Boyz selects "Bold"
- Same content, different visual presentation!

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Database & Migration
1. Create `vendor_storefront_sections` table
2. Extract Flora Distro's content from current components
3. Insert into database as "default" template content
4. Link to Flora Distro vendor

### Phase 2: Content Consumer Components
1. Create generic section renderers
2. Each reads from database instead of hardcoded
3. Template-agnostic (works with any template)
4. Props: sectionData (from JSONB)

### Phase 3: Update Templates
1. Replace hardcoded content with content consumers
2. Templates only define HOW content renders
3. Content comes from database

### Phase 4: Content Editor UI
1. Build dashboard pages
2. Form builder for each section type
3. Save to database
4. Preview mode

### Phase 5: AI Integration
1. Copy default content for new vendors
2. AI reword based on brand
3. Allow vendor editing
4. Instant rebranding
