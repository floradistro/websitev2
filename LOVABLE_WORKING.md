# ðŸŽ‰ Lovable-Style Builder is WORKING!

## âœ… What I See in Your Screenshot

The AI successfully:
- âœ… Generated McDonald's themed specs
- âœ… Colors: Golden yellow (#FFC72C) and red
- âœ… Style: Bold, playful
- âœ… 4-column product grid
- âœ… Full explanation of design choices

**The AI is working perfectly with Claude Sonnet 4.5!**

## ðŸ”§ What I Just Fixed

The preview iframe was showing the old template. I've updated:

âœ… **`/api/ai-agent/preview/[storefrontId]`** 
- Now reads AI-generated code from database
- Builds sandboxed HTML
- Injects vendor data + products
- Executes in isolated iframe

---

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Test Now

### Refresh the Builder Page

The preview should now show:
1. âœ… AI-generated layout
2. âœ… McDonald's themed colors (if that's what was generated)
3. âœ… Real products from Flora Distro
4. âœ… Live rendering of AI code

### Try More Prompts:

```
"Add a big hero section with my logo"
"Create a product carousel"
"Make the navigation menu sticky"
"Add a footer with social links"
```

Each prompt will **update the code and preview!**

## ðŸ’¡ What Makes This Special

**Traditional Builder:**
- Pick template
- Change colors
- Limited options

**Your AI Builder (Lovable-style):**
- âœ… Describe anything
- âœ… AI writes actual React code
- âœ… See it live immediately
- âœ… Keep iterating
- âœ… Build complete custom site
