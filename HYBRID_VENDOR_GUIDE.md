# üè™ Hybrid Vendor Guide: Retail + Wholesale

## Overview

Your wholesale system supports **hybrid vendors** who operate as BOTH retailers and distributors. This allows a single vendor to:
- ‚úÖ Sell to consumers (retail)
- ‚úÖ Sell to businesses (wholesale)
- ‚úÖ Use different pricing for each market
- ‚úÖ Maintain separate product catalogs

---

## üéØ Three Vendor Types

### 1. **Standard (Retail Only)**
- Sells directly to consumers
- Products visible on main marketplace
- No wholesale capabilities
- Default for new vendors

### 2. **Distributor (Wholesale Only)**
- Sells only to vendors and approved businesses
- Products hidden from consumers
- Only visible in `/wholesale` marketplace
- Requires wholesale approval to view

### 3. **Both (Hybrid) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED**
- Operates in BOTH markets
- Can have retail products AND wholesale products
- Dual pricing structures
- Maximum flexibility

---

## üîß Setting Up a Hybrid Vendor

### Method 1: Admin UI (Easy)

1. Go to `/admin/vendors`
2. Click on a vendor
3. Click "Wholesale Settings"
4. Select **"Both (Retail + Wholesale)"**
5. Configure:
   - Enable wholesale operations
   - Set minimum order amount (e.g., $500)
   - Add distributor terms
   - Optional: Add license info
6. Click "Save"

### Method 2: SQL (Direct)

```sql
UPDATE vendors 
SET 
  vendor_type = 'both',
  wholesale_enabled = true,
  minimum_order_amount = 500.00,
  distributor_terms = 'Retail and wholesale available. Volume discounts for wholesale orders over $500.'
WHERE id = 'YOUR_VENDOR_ID';
```

---

## üì¶ Product Configuration

For hybrid vendors, you can configure products individually:

### Retail-Only Product
```sql
UPDATE products
SET
  is_wholesale = false,
  wholesale_only = false
WHERE id = 'product-id';
```
**Result:** Visible only on main marketplace to consumers

### Wholesale-Only Product
```sql
UPDATE products
SET
  is_wholesale = true,
  wholesale_only = true,
  minimum_wholesale_quantity = 10,
  wholesale_price = 99.99
WHERE id = 'product-id';
```
**Result:** Visible only in `/wholesale` to approved buyers

### Available to Both Markets
```sql
UPDATE products
SET
  is_wholesale = true,
  wholesale_only = false,
  regular_price = 149.99,
  wholesale_price = 99.99,
  minimum_wholesale_quantity = 10
WHERE id = 'product-id';
```
**Result:** 
- Consumers see it for $149.99 (retail price)
- Wholesale buyers see it for $99.99 with 10+ unit minimum

---

## üí∞ Dual Pricing Example

### Product: "Premium Widget"

**Retail Customers:**
- Price: $149.99
- Quantity: 1 minimum
- Available: Main marketplace

**Wholesale Customers:**
- Price: $99.99 (33% discount)
- Quantity: 10 minimum
- Available: Wholesale marketplace
- Tier pricing:
  - 10-49 units: $99.99/ea
  - 50-99 units: $89.99/ea
  - 100+ units: $79.99/ea

|-------------|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Retail only | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Configure Vendor
```
Visit: /admin/vendors/[vendor-id]/wholesale-settings
Select: "Both (Retail + Wholesale)"
Enable: Wholesale operations
Set: Minimum order amount
```

- Set wholesale pricing
- Add tier pricing (optional)

### Step 3: Test
- View retail site as consumer
- Login as vendor/wholesale customer

---

## üí° Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Set clear minimum order amounts
- Offer volume discounts for wholesale
- Write detailed distributor terms
- Keep retail and wholesale SKUs organized
- Use tier pricing to encourage bulk orders

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Make wholesale prices higher than retail
- Set minimum orders too low (defeats purpose)
- Forget to enable wholesale operations
- Mix up retail vs wholesale product flags

---

## üìà Revenue Optimization

### Pricing Strategy
```
Retail Price: $150 (Base + margin for individual sales)
Wholesale Tiers:
  - 10-49 units: $100 (33% off - small wholesale)
  - 50-99 units: $90 (40% off - medium wholesale)  
  - 100+ units: $80 (47% off - large wholesale)
```

### Why This Works:
- Retail maintains brand value
- Wholesale volume compensates for lower margin
- Tiered pricing encourages larger orders
- Both channels remain profitable

---

## üîç Monitoring

- Retail revenue vs wholesale revenue
- Average order value by type
- Customer acquisition by channel
- Inventory turnover rates

### Admin Dashboard Shows:
