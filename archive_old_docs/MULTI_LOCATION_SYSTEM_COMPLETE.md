# ✅ Multi-Location Vendor System - COMPLETE

## What Was Built

A complete multi-location management system that integrates seamlessly with your existing Supabase architecture.

---

## Architecture (Clean & Industry Standard ✅)

### Single Source of Truth:
```
public.locations (enhanced with billing columns)
├── Existing columns: name, slug, type, vendor_id, address, phone, etc.
└── NEW columns: is_primary, pos_enabled, pricing_tier, billing_status, monthly_fee

Linked to:
├── public.inventory (location_id FK)
├── public.pos_transactions (location_id FK)
└── public.stock_movements (from/to location_id FK)
```

**No duplicate tables. Zero data duplication. Industry best practice.**

---

## Features

### 1. Admin Dashboard (`/admin/locations`)
- View all vendor locations
- Filter by vendor
- Create new locations
- Edit locations (name, address, POS, pricing)
- Delete non-primary locations
- Unified floating modal

### 2. Vendor Dashboard (`/vendor/locations`)
- Coming next (not yet built)

### 3. Pricing Model
- **Primary location** (warehouse): FREE ($0/month)
- **Additional locations**: $49.99/month each (configurable)
- **Pricing tiers**: standard/premium/enterprise/custom
- **Billing status**: active/trial/suspended/cancelled

---

## Database Migration

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251021_enhance_locations_for_multi_location.sql`

**Status:** ✅ APPLIED

**What it does:**
- Adds billing columns to existing `locations` table
- Sets existing warehouses as primary (free)
- Adds `total_locations` count to vendors table
- Creates triggers for auto-counting
- Creates views for billing summaries
- Adds helper functions

---

## UI Updates

### Edge-to-Edge Design (All Admin Pages):
- ✅ Dashboard
- ✅ Vendors
- ✅ Locations  
- ✅ Products
- ✅ Approvals
- ✅ Users

**Design Pattern:**
- Mobile: Edge-to-edge with border-t/border-b
- Desktop: Proper padding and borders
- Unified `AdminModal` component
- Floating modals with subtle blur
- Square, minimal aesthetic

---

## API Endpoints

### Admin Location Management:
- `GET /api/admin/locations?vendor_id=uuid` - List locations
- `POST /api/admin/locations` with actions:
  - `create` - Create new location
  - `update` - Update location details
  - `delete` - Delete location
  - `toggle_status` - Activate/deactivate
  - `set_primary` - Set as primary

### Admin Vendor Management:
- `GET /api/admin/vendors` - List all vendors
- `POST /api/admin/vendors` with actions:
  - `update` - Update vendor info
  - `suspend` - Suspend vendor
  - `activate` - Activate vendor
  - `delete` - Delete vendor (with cascade cleanup)

---

## Deletion Cascade (Fixed ✅)

Vendor deletion now works correctly:
1. Find all vendor locations
2. Delete stock_movements (references locations)
3. Delete inventory (references locations)
4. Delete locations
5. Delete products
6. Delete auth user
7. Delete vendor record

---

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `components/AdminModal.tsx` - Unified modal component
- `app/api/admin/locations/route.ts` - Location API
- `app/admin/locations/page.tsx` - Location management UI
- `supabase/migrations/20251021_enhance_locations_for_multi_location.sql`

### Modified Files:
- `lib/supabase/client.ts` - Added Location type
- `app/admin/layout.tsx` - Added Locations menu
- `app/vendor/layout.tsx` - Added Locations menu
- `app/api/admin/vendors/route.ts` - Added update action, fixed deletion
- `app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx` - Edge-to-edge design
- `app/admin/vendors/page.tsx` - Edge-to-edge design + edit modal
- `app/admin/products/page.tsx` - Edge-to-edge design
- `app/admin/approvals/page.tsx` - Edge-to-edge design
- `app/admin/users/page.tsx` - Edge-to-edge design

## How It Works

### Vendor Has Multiple Locations:
1. Vendor created → gets 1 primary location (warehouse, free)
2. Admin or vendor adds more locations (retail stores, $49.99/mo each)
3. Each location has independent:
   - Inventory tracking
   - POS sales
   - Stock movements
   - Pricing (if needed)

### Example Flow:
```
Vendor "Moonwater"
├── Ashvegas (Primary, Warehouse) - FREE
├── Store #2 (Retail) - $49.99/mo
└── Store #3 (Retail) - $49.99/mo

Monthly billing: $99.98 (2 additional locations)
```

---

## What Works Now

✅ Admin can create/edit/delete locations  
✅ Primary locations always free  
✅ Additional locations billed  
✅ POS can be toggled per location  
✅ Pricing tiers customizable  
✅ Existing inventory/POS/transfers work per location  
✅ Vendor deletion with proper cascade  
✅ Vendor editing  
✅ All admin pages edge-to-edge design  
✅ Unified floating modals

## Next Steps

1. **Vendor Dashboard** - Build `/vendor/locations` page
2. **Inventory UI** - Add location selector to inventory management
3. **POS Integration** - Enable POS API per location
4. **Billing Automation** - Auto-charge monthly per location
5. **Location Analytics** - Per-location performance tracking

---

**Status:** ✅ Admin side complete, ready for vendor dashboard
