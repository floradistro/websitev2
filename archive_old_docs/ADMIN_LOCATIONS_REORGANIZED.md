## 🔧 Technical Changes

### State Management
- Added `expandedVendors` Set to track which vendors are expanded
- Added `toggleVendor()` function to expand/collapse
- Added `vendorGroups` computed array to group locations by vendor

### Component Structure
```tsx
{vendorGroups.map((group) => (
  <VendorCard key={group.vendor.id}>
    <VendorHeader onClick={toggleVendor}>
      {vendor.store_name} ... {locations.length} location(s)
    </VendorHeader>
    
    {isExpanded && (
      <LocationsList>
        {group.locations.map(location => (
          <LocationCard />
        ))}
      </LocationsList>
    )}
  </VendorCard>
))}
```

### UI Improvements
- Removed vendor dropdown filter (no longer needed)
- Removed vendor name from individual location cards
- Added ChevronDown/ChevronUp icons
- Improved spacing and visual hierarchy
- Better border usage for grouping

## 📊 Benefits

2. **Better Organization**: Locations naturally grouped by ownership
3. **Easier Navigation**: Quick collapse to see all vendors at once
4. **Scalability**: Works great with 1 location or 100 locations
5. **Better UX**: Users naturally understand vendor → locations hierarchy
6. **Faster Loading**: All locations load at once, no re-fetching
7. **Mobile Friendly**: Collapsible cards reduce scrolling

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/admin/locations
2. See all vendors with location counts
3. Click any vendor card to expand/collapse
4. Manage individual locations within expanded sections
5. Use "Add Location" to create new locations for any vendor
