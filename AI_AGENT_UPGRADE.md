# AI Agent Upgrade - Code Platform

## What Was Upgraded

### 1. Extended Thinking 🧠
- **Added:** 5,000 token thinking budget for complex tasks
- **Benefit:** Claude can now think through complex problems before generating code
- **Use Case:** When asked to copy designs from apple.com, Claude can analyze and plan the approach

### 2. Exa Web Search 🔍
- **Added:** Real-time web search capability via Exa API
- **What it does:** Claude can search the web for:
  - Design inspiration (e.g., "apple.com design patterns")
  - Code examples and best practices
  - Current documentation
  - Competitor analysis
- **How it works:** Claude decides when to use search and automatically fetches relevant content

### 3. GitHub Code Reading 📖
- **Added:** Ability to read current files from the app's repository
- **What it does:**
  - Reads existing code before modifying it
  - Understands the current state of the app
  - Makes intelligent updates instead of rewriting from scratch
- **Functions added:**
  - `getRepositoryFiles()` - List all files in repo
  - `getFileContent()` - Read specific file contents

### 4. Tool Use Framework 🛠️
Claude now has access to two powerful tools:

**Tool 1: `web_search`**
```typescript
{
  name: 'web_search',
  description: 'Search the web for current information, design inspiration, code examples...',
  inputs: {
    query: string,
    num_results: number (default 3, max 10)
  }
}
```

**Tool 2: `get_current_code`**
```typescript
{
  name: 'get_current_code',
  description: 'Get the current code from a file in the app repository',
  inputs: {
    filepath: string  // e.g., "app/page.tsx"
  }
}
```

### 5. Enhanced System Prompt 📝
**New capabilities explained to Claude:**
- Current app context (files, repo, status)
- Available tools and when to use them
- Workflow: Research → Read → Think → Code
- Strict filename requirements for code generation

### 6. Multi-Turn Conversations 🔄
- **Added:** Automatic second API call when tools are used
- **Flow:**
  1. User requests something → Claude decides to use tool
  2. Tool executes (web search or code reading)
  3. Results sent back to Claude
  4. Claude generates final code with context

### 7. Better Error Handling ⚠️
- More detailed logging
- Better error messages
- Stack trace capture for debugging

## Example Workflow

**User Request:** "Make a cool custom homepage for my app, copy design from apple.com"

**What Happens:**

1. **🧠 Thinking Phase** (5000 tokens)
   - Claude analyzes the request
   - Decides to search web for apple.com design patterns

2. **🔍 Web Search**
   - Searches: "apple.com homepage design patterns modern minimalist"
   - Gets 3-5 relevant results with content

3. **📖 Read Current Code**
   - Reads `app/page.tsx` to see what exists
   - Understands current structure

4. **🧠 More Thinking**
   - Analyzes search results
   - Plans the design approach
   - Decides on color scheme, layout, components

5. **💻 Code Generation**
   - Creates modern, apple-inspired design
   - Uses Tailwind CSS
   - Includes proper TypeScript types
   - Adds filename comments

6. **🚀 Deployment**
   - Code committed to GitHub
   - Vercel auto-deploys
   - Preview updates in ~10 seconds

## Technical Details

### API Configuration
```typescript
model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514'
max_tokens: 8000  // Increased from 4096
thinking: {
  type: 'enabled',
  budget_tokens: 5000  // NEW!
}
tools: [web_search, get_current_code]  // NEW!
```

### Cost Implications
- **Thinking tokens:** Counted as input tokens (~$3/1M)
- **Web search:** Adds ~500-1000 tokens per search
- **Tool use overhead:** ~20% more tokens per request
- **Benefit:** Much better code quality, fewer iterations

### Example Costs
- **Simple edit:** $0.01 - $0.03 (no tools)
- **With web search:** $0.03 - $0.08 (research + code)
- **Complex task:** $0.08 - $0.15 (multiple tools + thinking)

## Before vs After

### Before ❌
```
User: "Make it look like apple.com"
Claude: "I'll create a clean design..."
Result: Generic clean design, not apple-like
```

### After ✅
```
User: "Make it look like apple.com"
Claude:
  1. Searches "apple.com design patterns"
  2. Reads current code
  3. Thinks through approach
  4. Creates authentic apple-inspired design
Result: Professional apple-style homepage
```

## Testing the Upgrade

### Test 1: Web Search
```
Prompt: "Research the best React animation libraries and add one to my app"
Expected: Claude searches web, finds recommendations, implements Framer Motion
```

### Test 2: Code Reading
```
Prompt: "Update the homepage to add a footer"
Expected: Claude reads current page.tsx, adds footer without breaking existing code
```

### Test 3: Complex Task
```
Prompt: "Make a cool homepage copying apple.com design"
Expected: Claude searches apple.com → reads current code → thinks → generates apple-style design
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...  # Already configured ✅
EXA_API_KEY=...                # Already configured ✅ (as EXASEARCH_API_KEY)
GITHUB_BOT_TOKEN=...           # Already configured ✅
```

### Files Modified
1. `/app/api/vendor/ai-edit/route.ts` - Main AI agent logic
2. `/lib/deployment/github.ts` - Added `getFileContent()` function
3. `package.json` - Added `exa-js` dependency

## Monitoring

### Console Logs to Watch
```
✓ Calling Anthropic API with instruction: ...
✓ Claude thinking: ...
✓ Tool use: web_search
✓ Searching web: "..."
✓ Tool use: get_current_code
✓ Found X code blocks
✓ Committing X files to repo
✓ AI edit completed successfully
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Web Search Rate Limits**
   - Exa API: 1000 requests/month on free tier
   - Solution: Upgrade to paid tier if needed

2. **Thinking Token Budget**
   - Max 5000 tokens for thinking
   - Very complex tasks may hit this limit

3. **File Reading**
   - Can only read one file at a time
   - Large files (>100KB) may be truncated

## Future Enhancements

1. **Image Search** - Add image search for visual inspiration
2. **Multi-file Context** - Read multiple related files at once
3. **Caching** - Cache search results to reduce API calls
4. **Streaming** - Stream responses for better UX
5. **Code Review** - Add tool for reviewing generated code
