## ⚠️ What Needs Configuration

### 1. WordPress Plugin Installation

**File**: `authorize-net-api-payment.php`

**Status**: Created but NOT installed on live site

**To Install**:
```bash
# SSH into server
ssh u2736-pgt6vpiklij1@gvam1142.siteground.biz -p 18765

# Upload to
/public_html/wp-content/plugins/authorize-net-api-payment.php

# Activate in WordPress Admin → Plugins
```

**What it does**:
- Listens for new WooCommerce orders
- Extracts payment token from order meta
- Calls Authorize.net API to process payment
- Updates order status (paid/failed)
- Adds payment notes to order

### 2. Authorize.net Gateway Configuration

**Location**: WooCommerce → Settings → Payments → Authorize.net CIM

**Required Settings**:
- ✅ Enable/Disable: **Checked**
- **API Login ID**: [Your Authorize.net login]
- **Transaction Key**: [Your transaction key]
- **Public Client Key**: [Your public key]
- **Environment**: Production (or Sandbox for testing)
- **Transaction Type**: Authorize and Capture

**Current Status**: Not configured

### 3. Apple Pay (Optional - Currently Disabled)

**Status**: Disabled with error message

**Why**: Requires Apple Developer merchant certificate and validation

**To Enable**:
1. Register domain with Apple Developer
2. Download merchant ID verification file
3. Upload to `/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association`
4. Configure in Authorize.net merchant interface
5. Create WordPress endpoint: `/wp-json/flora/v1/apple-pay/validate`
6. Uncomment Apple Pay code in checkout

**Current behavior**: Shows "Apple Pay not configured" error

## 🔴 Critical Missing Pieces

### 1. Payment Actually Doesn't Process Yet

**Problem**: Orders are created in WooCommerce, but payment doesn't get charged

**Why**: WordPress plugin not installed + Authorize.net not configured

**What happens now**:
1. ✅ User fills out checkout
2. ✅ Accept.js tokenizes card
3. ✅ Order created in WooCommerce
4. ❌ Payment token sits in order meta (unused)
5. ❌ No charge to credit card
6. ❌ Order stuck in "Pending Payment"

**To Fix**:
1. Install `authorize-net-api-payment.php` on WordPress
2. Configure Authorize.net credentials in WooCommerce
3. Test with real card

### 2. Order Status Not Updated

**Problem**: Orders stay in "Pending" status

**Why**: Payment not processing

**Expected Flow**:
1. Order created → "Pending Payment"
2. Plugin processes payment → "Processing"
3. Payment approved → "Processing" or "Completed"
4. Payment declined → "Failed"

**Current**:  Order stays "Pending Payment" forever

### 3. Customer Notifications

**Status**: Will work once payment processes

WooCommerce sends emails automatically:
- Order confirmation (when order created)
- Processing order (when payment approved)
- Completed order (when shipped/fulfilled)

**Currently**: Only "pending payment" email sent
