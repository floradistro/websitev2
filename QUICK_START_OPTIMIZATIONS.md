## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Images not loading?
Check that WordPress API is accessible:
```bash
curl https://api.floradistro.com/wp-json/wc/v3/products
```

### Build fails?
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf .next
npm run build
```

### Slow API responses?
Check network tab in DevTools. If API is slow, it's a backend issue, not frontend.
