# RBAC System - Ready to Use! 🎉

## ✅ What's Working Now (Without Migration)

Your system now has **backwards-compatible authentication** that works perfectly:

### How to Use:
1. **Log in** at: http://localhost:3000/vendor/login
   - Use your vendor credentials
   - System automatically uses legacy auth

2. **View Apps Dashboard** at: http://localhost:3000/vendor/apps
   - Shows all 8 apps (POS, Orders, Menus, etc.)
   - Beautiful grid layout with role badge
   - Works perfectly with current auth

3. **Navigate seamlessly** between apps
   - Click any app card to go there
   - No re-login needed
   - Apple-like experience

## 🚀 To Enable Full RBAC (Employee Management)

Run this SQL in Supabase Studio to enable employee accounts and permissions:

### Step 1: Go to SQL Editor
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/uaednwpxursknmwdeejn/sql

### Step 2: Copy & Run This SQL

Open the file: `/supabase/migrations/20251027_rbac_system.sql`

Copy all contents and paste into SQL editor, then click "Run".

### What This Adds:
- ✅ User roles (vendor_admin, manager, employee)
- ✅ App permissions system
- ✅ Location assignments for employees
- ✅ Activity logging
- ✅ Full RBAC with RLS policies
