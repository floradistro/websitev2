## Known Limitations

**SiteGround Cache Issue:**
- 5 products (41819, 41817, 41815, 41802, 41796) don't have inventory records
- Auto-create code is deployed but cached
- Will work after cache expires (24-48 hours)
- **Workaround:** Use products 41794, 41795 (fully functional)

**Solution for Future:**
- All new products approved will have inventory auto-created
- Code is deployed and ready
- Will activate once cache clears
