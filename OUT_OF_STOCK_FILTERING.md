# üì¶ OUT OF STOCK PRODUCT FILTERING

## Overview

Products that are **completely out of stock** across all locations are now **hidden from the site** everywhere.

---

## ‚úÖ Where Products Are Filtered

### 1. **Homepage** (`app/page.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Only shows in-stock products in Featured Products carousel
- ‚úÖ Checks inventory across all locations
- ‚úÖ Products with 0 stock everywhere = hidden

### 2. **Products Page** (`app/products/page.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ All category views only show in-stock products
- ‚úÖ Location filter still works (shows products in stock at selected location)
- ‚úÖ Products with 0 stock everywhere = hidden from listings

### 3. **Product Detail Page** (`app/products/[id]/page.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Returns 404 if product is out of stock everywhere
- ‚úÖ Users cannot view or add to cart
- ‚úÖ Direct links to out-of-stock products = 404 page

### 4. **Related Products** (`app/products/[id]/page.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ "You may also like" section only shows in-stock products
- ‚úÖ No out-of-stock recommendations

### 5. **Search Results** (`app/api/search/route.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Search only returns in-stock products
- ‚úÖ Out-of-stock products won't appear in search results

## üîç How It Works

### Stock Check Logic

```typescript
const hasStockAnywhere = (productId: number): boolean => {
  const inventory = inventoryMap[productId] || [];
  return inventory.some((inv: any) => {
    const qty = parseFloat(inv.stock_quantity || inv.quantity || inv.stock || 0);
    const status = inv.status?.toLowerCase();
    return qty > 0 || status === 'instock' || status === 'in_stock';
  });
};
```

**Product is considered IN STOCK if:**
- Quantity > 0 at ANY location, OR
- Status is 'instock' or 'in_stock' at ANY location

**Product is considered OUT OF STOCK if:**
- Quantity = 0 at ALL locations, AND
- Status is NOT 'instock' at ANY location

## üìä User Experience

### Before
- ‚ùå Out-of-stock products visible everywhere
- ‚ùå Users could click and see "Out of Stock"
- ‚ùå Frustrating experience
- ‚ùå Bad for SEO (Google sees unavailable products)

### After
- ‚úÖ Only in-stock products visible
- ‚úÖ Users only see what they can buy
- ‚úÖ Better conversion rates
- ‚úÖ Better SEO (Google only indexes available products)
- ‚úÖ Cleaner product listings

---

## üé® Visual Changes

### Product Cards
Out-of-stock products are now **completely hidden** instead of showing with opacity and "Out of Stock" badge.

**Before:**
```
Product 1 [In Stock]
Product 2 [Out of Stock - grayed out]
Product 3 [In Stock]
```

**After:**
```
Product 1 [In Stock]
Product 3 [In Stock]
Product 4 [In Stock]
```

## üí° Edge Cases Handled

### 1. **Product Out of Stock During Session**
- ISR caching means page updates every 5-10 minutes
- If product goes out of stock, it disappears on next cache refresh
- Users who have product page open can still view but cart won't accept

### 2. **Last Item Purchased**
- Real-time inventory updates in WordPress
- Next cache refresh removes product from listings
- 404 shown if someone tries to access directly

### 3. **Restocked Products**
- Product automatically reappears when restocked
- Shows up in all listings after cache refresh (5-10 min)

### 4. **Location-Specific Stock**
- If product is in stock at Location A but not Location B
- Product shows in overall listings
- Location filter shows it only for Location A
- Stock badge shows "In Stock ¬∑ 1 location"

---

## üîÑ Cache & Performance

### Cache Behavior
- **Homepage:** 5-minute cache
- **Products Page:** 5-minute cache
- **Product Detail:** 10-minute cache
- **Search:** No cache (always fresh)

### What This Means
- Product goes out of stock ‚Üí takes up to 10 minutes to disappear
- Product restocked ‚Üí takes up to 10 minutes to reappear
- This is intentional for performance (prevents constant DB hits)

### Force Refresh (If Needed)
To see changes immediately during development:
1. Clear cache button in header (for users)
2. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. In production: Vercel automatically handles ISR
