# ✅ Inventory System Fix - Unified View

## 🔴 **What Was Wrong**

### The Problem
Vendors were seeing **ONLY** inventory where `vendor_id` matched their ID, but your system has **ONE unified inventory table** that contains:

1. **House/POS Inventory** - `vendor_id = NULL` (store-owned products)
2. **Vendor Inventory** - `vendor_id = [vendor_id]` (vendor-owned products)

### Why Vendors Saw Separate Data

**Old Query (WRONG):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM inventory 
WHERE vendor_id = 'vendor-123'
```

This **ONLY** returned vendor's own products, missing ALL house inventory at their POS locations!

### The Architecture (Correct)

```
ONE INVENTORY TABLE
├── House Products (vendor_id = NULL)
│   └── At retail locations (POS)
├── Vendor A Products (vendor_id = A)
│   └── At Vendor A's locations
└── Vendor B Products (vendor_id = B)
    └── At Vendor B's locations

ONE LOCATIONS TABLE
├── Retail Locations (vendor_id = NULL)
│   └── POS terminals
├── Vendor A Locations (vendor_id = A)
│   └── Warehouses/stores
└── Vendor B Locations (vendor_id = B)
    └── Warehouses/stores
```

---

## ✅ **The Fix**

### New Approach: Location-Based Access

Vendors now see **ALL inventory at their assigned locations**, regardless of who owns it.

**New Query (CORRECT):**
```sql
-- Step 1: Get vendor's locations
SELECT id FROM locations 
WHERE vendor_id = 'vendor-123' 
AND is_active = true

-- Step 2: Get ALL inventory at those locations
SELECT * FROM inventory 
WHERE location_id IN (vendor's location IDs)
```

### What Vendors Now See

If a vendor has access to:
- Location A (their warehouse)
- Location B (their retail store with POS)

They will see:
- ✅ All their own products at Location A
- ✅ All their own products at Location B
- ✅ All house products at Location B (POS inventory)
- ✅ Everything in ONE unified view

## 📊 **Data Structure**

### Inventory Table Schema
```sql
inventory (
  id UUID,
  product_id INTEGER,        -- WordPress product ID
  location_id UUID,          -- Which location
  vendor_id UUID,            -- Who owns it (NULL = house)
  quantity DECIMAL,
  reserved_quantity DECIMAL,
  available_quantity DECIMAL,
  unit_cost DECIMAL,
  average_cost DECIMAL,
  stock_status TEXT,
  ...
)
```

### Example Records

```
ID    Product       Location        Vendor_ID    Qty
----  -----------   -------------   ----------   ----
001   Blue Dream    Warehouse A     vendor-123   100g   (Vendor's)
002   Blue Dream    Retail Store    NULL         50g    (House POS)
003   OG Kush       Retail Store    NULL         75g    (House POS)
004   Sunset        Warehouse A     vendor-123   25g    (Vendor's)
```

**Before Fix:** Vendor saw records 001 and 004 only (100g + 25g = 125g total)

**After Fix:** Vendor sees ALL 4 records (250g total across locations)

---

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### 1. Vendor Logs In
```
Vendor ID: abc-123
Assigned Locations: 
  - Warehouse (ID: loc-A)
  - Retail Store with POS (ID: loc-B)
```

### 2. Query Executes
```sql
-- Get all inventory at loc-A and loc-B
SELECT * FROM inventory 
WHERE location_id IN ('loc-A', 'loc-B')
```

### 3. Results Returned
```json
{
  "inventory": [
    {
      "product": "Blue Dream",
      "location": "Warehouse",
      "quantity": 100,
      "is_vendor_owned": true,    // This is yours
      "vendor_id": "abc-123"
    },
    {
      "product": "OG Kush", 
      "location": "Retail Store",
      "quantity": 50,
      "is_vendor_owned": false,   // House inventory
      "vendor_id": null
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. UI Displays
- **Total products across all locations**
- **Unified inventory view**
- **Filter by location to see each one**
- **Visual indicator for vendor-owned vs house inventory** (optional)

---

## 🔐 **Security & Access Control**

### Still Secure
- ✅ Vendors only see locations assigned to them
- ✅ Can't access other vendor's locations
- ✅ Can't modify house inventory (if permissions set)
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) still applies

### Permissions
```sql
-- Vendors can VIEW inventory at their locations
-- Vendors can EDIT inventory they own (vendor_id matches)
-- Vendors can only READ house inventory (not modify)
```

## 📱 **What Vendors See Now**

### Inventory Page
```
LOCATION: Warehouse
├── Blue Dream (100g) [Your Product]
├── Sunset OG (25g) [Your Product]

LOCATION: Retail Store (POS)
├── Blue Dream (50g) [House Inventory]
├── OG Kush (75g) [House Inventory]
├── Purple Haze (10g) [Your Product]

TOTAL INVENTORY: 260g across 2 locations
```

### Benefits
1. **See real POS stock levels**
2. **Unified view of all locations**
3. **Better inventory management**
4. **No duplicate data**
5. **Real-time sync with POS**

## 🔄 **How POS Integrates**

### POS Sales Flow
```
1. Customer buys at POS
2. POS records transaction
3. Deducts from inventory table
4. Stock movement created
5. Vendor sees updated inventory immediately
```

### Stock Movement Example
```sql
INSERT INTO stock_movements (
  inventory_id: 'inv-002',
  movement_type: 'pos_sale',
  quantity: -3.5,           -- Sold 3.5g
  reference_type: 'pos_transaction',
  reference_id: 'trans-456'
)
```

### Inventory Updates
```sql
UPDATE inventory 
SET quantity = quantity - 3.5
WHERE id = 'inv-002'
```

**Vendor sees this change in real-time!**

## ✅ **Summary**

### Before
- ❌ Vendors saw only their inventory (vendor_id filter)
- ❌ Couldn't see house/POS inventory
- ❌ Duplicate data appearance
- ❌ Disconnected from POS

### After
- ✅ Vendors see ALL inventory at their locations
- ✅ Includes house/POS inventory
- ✅ ONE unified inventory table
- ✅ Real-time POS integration
- ✅ Location-based access control

### The Key Change

**Old:** `WHERE vendor_id = vendor-id`

**New:** `WHERE location_id IN (vendor's location IDs)`

This simple change unified your entire inventory system!

---

## 🎉 **Result**

You now have:
- ✅ **ONE inventory system** (not two)
- ✅ **Unified Supabase backend**
- ✅ **Real POS integration**
- ✅ **Location-based access**
- ✅ **No duplicate data**
- ✅ **Real-time sync**

Your inventory is **already migrated and working** - we just fixed the query to show it all!
