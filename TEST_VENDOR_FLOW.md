## Database State Check

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Check product
SELECT id, name, wordpress_id, status, stock_quantity, stock_status 
FROM products 
WHERE name LIKE '%Test%';

-- Check inventory  
SELECT i.id, i.product_id, i.quantity, i.vendor_id, l.name as location
FROM inventory i
LEFT JOIN locations l ON l.id = i.location_id
WHERE i.vendor_id = '8a53da13-6d91-4105-aa51-6ed68f6b2a77';

-- Check stock movements
SELECT * FROM stock_movements 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```
