/**
 * This class represents a modified stack data structure that grows dynamically if consumed too soon.
 * A modified stack is a stack that has an additional operation: unshift.
 * Unshift inserts an element at the bottom of the stack, shifting all the other elements up by one position.
 * The capacity is fixed, determined at construction time.
 * If it reaches its maximum capacity, it cannot push or unshift any more elements, and it will return undefined.
 * If is below a low watermark level, determined by the constructor parameter,
 * it will refill itself by unshifting new elements created by a function, also provided by the constructor parameter.
 * This way, the modified stack can always have enough elements to pop when needed.
 * Can be visualized this way:
 * - item -> pop last item
 * - item
 * - item
 * - item
 * - item
 * - item
 *   --- watermark --- when we reach this level we refill by unshifting.
 * - item
 * - item
 * - item <- recycling
