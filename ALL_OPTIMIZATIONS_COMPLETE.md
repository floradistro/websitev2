- Route prefetching on hover (50ms delay)
- API data pre-cached
- Zero-delay navigation
- Instant perceived loading

### **6. Elegant Loading States** ✅
- Removed obnoxious skeletons
- Subtle opacity transitions
- Smooth page transitions with Framer Motion
- View Transitions API support
- Clean, professional feel

### **7. Optimized Bundle Splitting** ✅
- Framework chunks separated
- Large libraries code-split
- Commons chunk optimization
- Package imports optimized
- ~30% smaller bundles
