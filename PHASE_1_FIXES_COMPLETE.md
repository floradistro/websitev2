# üîß Phase 1 Fixes - COMPLETE

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Wishlist Pricing Issue
**Problem:** Wishlist showed WooCommerce base pricing instead of tier-based pricing  
**Solution:**
- Changed wishlist to show "View product for pricing" instead of price
- "Add to Cart" button now says "View Product"
- Clicking navigates to full product page where users can select pricing tiers
- Users can then choose proper tier and quantity

**Why:** Your pricing system uses custom tiers (not base WooCommerce prices), so we need to show the full product page for customers to select the right tier

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Recently Viewed Not Working
**Problem:** Recently viewed products weren't loading in dashboard  
**Solution:**
- Added support for multiple localStorage keys: `recentlyViewed` and `flora-recently-viewed`
- Added array and object format handling
- Added proper error handling
- Now checks both keys to find data

**Why:** The localStorage key name and format weren't matching - now it works with both formats

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Reorder Adding 4000+ Quantity
**Problem:** Clicking reorder was adding massive quantities to cart  
**Solution:**
- Fixed quantity parsing: `parseInt(item.quantity) || 1`
- Added proper price parsing: `parseFloat(item.price) || 0`
- Now correctly reads quantity from order line items
- Extracts tier name from order metadata

**Code Fix:**
```typescript
const qty = parseInt(item.quantity) || 1;  // Was: item.quantity (string)
const price = parseFloat(item.price) || 0; // Proper conversion
```

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Address Editing Not Available
**Problem:** Customers couldn't edit their billing or shipping addresses  
**Solution:**
- Added "Edit" button to both address sections
- Created inline editing form with all fields:
  - First Name, Last Name
  - Address Line 1, Address Line 2
  - City, State, ZIP Code
- Added "Save Address" and "Cancel" buttons
- Saves via WooCommerce API
- Page reloads to show updated address

**Features:**
- Edit billing address ‚úì
- Edit shipping address ‚úì
- Inline form (no modal) ‚úì
- WooCommerce API integration ‚úì
- Proper field styling ‚úì
- Save/Cancel actions ‚úì

## Technical Details

### Fixes Applied

#### Wishlist Context
```typescript
// Now navigates to product page instead of adding to cart
const handleAddWishlistItemToCart = (item: any) => {
  router.push(`/products/${item.productId}`);
};
```

#### Reorder Function
```typescript
const handleQuickReorder = async (order: Order) => {
  order.line_items.forEach((item: any) => {
    const qty = parseInt(item.quantity) || 1;  // Fixed
    const price = parseFloat(item.price) || 0; // Fixed
    
    addToCart({
      productId: item.product_id,
      name: item.name,
      price: price,
      quantity: qty,  // Correct now
      tierName: item.meta_data?.find((m: any) => m.key === 'tier_name')?.value || "Standard",
      image: item.image?.src,
    });
  });
  
  router.push("/checkout");
};
```

#### Recently Viewed Loader
```typescript
const loadRecentlyViewed = () => {
  const keys = ["recentlyViewed", "flora-recently-viewed"];
  
  for (const key of keys) {
    const viewed = localStorage.getItem(key);
    if (viewed) {
      const parsed = JSON.parse(viewed);
      if (Array.isArray(parsed)) {
        setRecentlyViewed(parsed);
        return;
      } else if (parsed.products && Array.isArray(parsed.products)) {
        setRecentlyViewed(parsed.products);
        return;
      }
    }
  }
  
  setRecentlyViewed([]);
};
```

#### Address Editing
```typescript
// Edit button for each address
<button onClick={() => handleEditAddress('billing')}>Edit</button>

// Inline form with all fields
const handleSaveAddress = async () => {
  const updateData: any = {};
  updateData[editingAddress] = addressForm;
  
  await axios.put(
    `${baseUrl}/wp-json/wc/v3/customers/${user.id}`,
    updateData
  );
  
  window.location.reload();
};
```
