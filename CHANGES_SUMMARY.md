## 2. OUT OF STOCK FILTERING (Complete)

### ðŸŽ¯ Products with 0 stock everywhere are now hidden

**What Was Done:**
- âœ… Homepage: Only shows in-stock products
- âœ… Products page: Filters out of stock products
- âœ… Product detail page: Returns 404 if no stock anywhere
- âœ… Related products: Only shows in-stock alternatives
- âœ… Search: Only returns in-stock products
- âœ… Improved product card styling for out-of-stock items

**Stock Check Logic:**
- Product is IN STOCK if it has qty > 0 at ANY location
- Product is OUT OF STOCK if it has qty = 0 at ALL locations
- Checks across all locations automatically

**User Experience:**
- Before: Out-of-stock products visible with "Out of Stock" badge
- After: Out-of-stock products completely hidden
- Result: Users only see products they can buy

**Files Modified:**
1. `app/page.tsx` - Added stock filtering
2. `app/products/page.tsx` - Added stock filtering
3. `app/products/[id]/page.tsx` - Added 404 for out-of-stock + filter related
4. `app/api/search/route.ts` - Filter search results
5. `components/ProductCard.tsx` - Improved out-of-stock styling

**Documentation Created:**
- `OUT_OF_STOCK_FILTERING.md` - Complete documentation

## 3. CONFIGURATION UPDATES

### User Applied Changes:

**`next.config.ts`:**
- Added `qualities` array to suppress Next.js 16 warnings
- Values: [50, 75, 85, 90, 95, 100]

**`app/page.tsx`:**
- Removed `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` (conflicted with ISR)
- ISR caching now works properly

**`components/ProductCard.tsx`:**
- Added opacity effect for out-of-stock items (now hidden by filtering)
- Improved "Out of Stock" badge styling with "Check back soon" message
- Added red dot with lower opacity for better visual hierarchy

**`app/layout.tsx`:**
- Added `metadataBase` for proper URL generation
- Uses `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` or localhost fallback
