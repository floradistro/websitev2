## **What Was Built Today:**

### **âœ… Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**

- Custom domain support (`floradistro.com` â†’ Flora Distro storefront)
- Subdomain support (`flora-distro.yachtclub.com`)
- Edge middleware for domain detection
- Vercel auto-domain integration with SSL

### **âœ… Phase 2: Storefront Design**

- Animated hero sections
- Product carousels

### **âœ… Phase 3: All Pages**
- **Home**: Hero, featured products, features grid, about section
- **Shop**: Full product catalog with filters
- **About**: Vendor story, business hours, policies
- **Contact**: Contact form, email link

### **âœ… Phase 4: Product Features**

## **Current Status:**

### **Working:**
âœ… Custom domain routing  
âœ… Flora Distro storefront live  
âœ… All pages functional  
âœ… Product fields showing (175 products with data)  
âœ… Locations showing in stock status  
âœ… Inventory tracking  
âœ… Mobile navigation  
âœ… Cart & wishlist  

### **Next: Pricing Tiers**
The pricing tier dropdowns require products to have `vendor_pricing_configs` set up. Currently most products don't have pricing configured yet.

**To add pricing tiers:**
1. Go to `/vendor/pricing` 
2. Select a product
3. Configure pricing tiers (1g, 3.5g, 7g, etc.)
4. Save
5. Pricing dropdown will appear on storefront
