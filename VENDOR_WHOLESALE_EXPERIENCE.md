# 🏪 Vendor Wholesale Experience - Complete Guide

## What Vendors See After Wholesale is Configured

---

## 🎯 Scenario: Flora Distro Configured as "Both" (Hybrid)

### Admin Configured:
```
Vendor Type: Both (Retail + Wholesale)
Wholesale Enabled: ✅ Yes
Minimum Order: $500
```

---

## 👁️ What the Vendor Sees

### 1. **Vendor Dashboard** (No Changes)

When vendor logs in to `/vendor/dashboard`, they see:
- Their normal dashboard
- Products, inventory, orders
- Sales stats and analytics
- **Nothing changes here** - business as usual

### 2. **Header Navigation** (NEW!)

When logged in as a vendor, the header now shows:
```
[Products] [Vendors] [About] [Contact] [🏪 Wholesale] [User Menu] [Cart]
                                         ↑
                                    NEW BUTTON!
```

The **"Wholesale" button appears automatically** for all vendors!

### 3. **Wholesale Marketplace Access**

When vendor clicks "Wholesale":
- Redirected to: `/wholesale`
- **Immediate access** (no application needed)
- See ALL distributor products from ALL other distributors
- Can browse and purchase at wholesale prices
- See tier pricing and volume discounts

---

## 📦 What Vendors Can Do

### As a Wholesale Buyer (All Vendors)

**Vendors can:**
- ✅ Access `/wholesale` marketplace
- ✅ Browse products from distributors
- ✅ See wholesale pricing
- ✅ View tier pricing (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
- ✅ Calculate volume discounts
- ✅ Add to cart at wholesale prices
- ✅ Place bulk orders

**Example:**
```
Flora Distro wants to buy from "Moonwater" distributor
  → Clicks "Wholesale" in header
  → Browses Moonwater's products
  → Sees tier pricing:
     • 10+ units: $100/ea
     • 50+ units: $80/ea
     • 100+ units: $70/ea
  → Orders 60 units at $80/ea
  → Total: $4,800 (saves $4,200 vs retail)
```

### As a Distributor (If Configured)

**If vendor is type "distributor" or "both":**
- ✅ Their products appear in wholesale marketplace
