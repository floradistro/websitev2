## 🚀 Test It Now (3 steps)

### Step 1: Start Dev Server
```bash
cd /Users/whale/Desktop/Website
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Access Builder
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/vendor/login
2. Login with any vendor account
3. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/vendor/storefront-builder

### Step 3: Chat with AI
Try these prompts:
```
"I want a minimalist black and white store"
"Create a luxury boutique with gold accents"
"Make a modern store with green tones"
```

## ⚠️ Note About Database

The migration has a minor hiccup with Supabase CLI sync.

**This doesn't affect testing!** The AI works perfectly without the database.

What works: ✅ AI generation, chat interface, specifications
What needs DB: ⏳ Saving conversations, deployment tracking

To complete migration:
- See `MANUAL_MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (2 minutes)
- Or test first, migrate later

## 🎯 Expected Results

When you chat with the AI, you'll get:

### Input:
"I want a minimalist store"

### Output:
```json
{
  "theme": {
    "style": "minimalist",
    "colors": { "primary": "#000000", ... },
    "typography": { "headingFont": "Inter", ... }
  },
  "layout": {
    "header": "sticky",
    "productGrid": 3,
    ...
  },
  "features": {
    "ageVerification": true,
    "productReviews": true,
    ...
  }
}
```

Plus a friendly AI explanation of design choices!
