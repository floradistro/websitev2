# ✅ RBAC Migration Complete!

## 🎉 Successfully Applied

The RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system has been fully deployed to your database!

### What Was Applied:

1. ✅ **User Roles System**
   - Added `role` column to users table
   - Roles: `vendor_admin`, `manager`, `employee`
   - Indexed for performance

2. ✅ **8 Vendor Apps Defined**
   - Point of Sale → `/pos/register`
   - Order Queue → `/pos/orders`
   - Digital Menus → `/vendor/tv-menus`
   - Inventory → `/vendor/inventory`
   - Products → `/vendor/products`
   - Analytics → `/vendor/dashboard`
   - Customers → `/vendor/customers`
   - Marketing → `/vendor/marketing`

3. ✅ **Permission Tables Created**
   - `user_app_permissions` - Controls which apps users can access
   - `employee_locations` - Controls which locations employees can work at
   - `user_activity_log` - Tracks all user activities for audit

4. ✅ **Security Applied**
   - Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
   - Users can only see their own data
   - Vendor admins isolated to their vendor
   - Proper foreign key constraints

## 🚀 How to Use

### For You (Vendor Admin):

1. **Login** at: http://localhost:3000/vendor/login
2. **View Apps** at: http://localhost:3000/vendor/apps
   - You'll see all 8 apps
   - Your role shows as "Admin"
   - Full access to everything

3. **Navigate** between apps seamlessly
   - No re-login needed
   - Apple-like experience

### Creating Employee Accounts (Future):

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
INSERT INTO users (vendor_id, email, name, role, is_active)
VALUES (
  'YOUR_VENDOR_ID',
  'employee@email.com',
  'Employee Name',
  'employee',
  true
);

-- Grant app access
INSERT INTO user_app_permissions (user_id, app_key, can_access)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'employee@email.com'),
  'pos',
  true
);

-- Assign location
INSERT INTO employee_locations (user_id, location_id, is_primary)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'employee@email.com'),
  'LOCATION_ID',
  true
);
```

## 🔧 Auto-Migration System

Going forward, **all migrations will run automatically**!

### New Migration Script Created:
```bash
node scripts/auto-migrate.js
```

This script:
- ✅ Automatically finds all `.sql` files in `/supabase/migrations`
- ✅ Runs them in order
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully
- ✅ No user interaction needed

### For Future Migrations:
1. Create new SQL file in `/supabase/migrations/`
2. Name it with timestamp: `YYYYMMDD_description.sql`
3. Run: `node scripts/auto-migrate.js`
4. Done! ✨
