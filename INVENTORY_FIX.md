# ✅ Inventory Display - Fixed

## The Problem

**Why everything showed "Out of Stock":**
1. Flora Distro has **0 locations** in database
2. Products have `inventory: []` (empty array)
3. Stock quantity is 0 even though status is "instock"
4. Component was checking inventory array first, finding nothing

## The Fix

**Added fallback logic:**
```typescript
if (!product.inventory || product.inventory.length === 0) {
  // No inventory data? Check basic stock status
  const inStock = product.stock_status === 'instock' || 
                  product.stock_status === 'in_stock' ||
                  (product.stock_quantity && product.stock_quantity > 0);
  
  return { inStock, locations: [], count: inStock ? 1 : 0 };
}
```

**Now displays:**
- ✅ **"In Stock"** if `stock_status === 'instock'` (even with 0 qty)
- ✅ **"In Stock · 2 locations"** if inventory data exists
- ✅ **Location names** when ≤2 locations have stock
- ✅ **"Out of Stock"** only when truly out

## Data Structure

### **Products API Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "name": "Purple Runtz",
  "stock_status": "instock",   ← This is the key field
  "stock_quantity": 0,          ← Often 0 (location-based instead)
  "inventory": []               ← Empty for Flora (no locations)
}
```

### **Stock Logic Priority:**
1. **If inventory array has data** → Check locations
2. **If inventory empty** → Check `stock_status`
3. **Fallback** → Check `stock_quantity > 0`

## Next Steps

**For vendors WITH locations:**
- Will show "In Stock · 2 locations"
- Will show location names
- Multi-location inventory works

**For vendors WITHOUT locations (like Flora):**
- Shows simple "In Stock" based on status
- Green dot appears
- Quick Add button enabled

**Result:** All Flora Distro products should now show "In Stock" with green dots! ✅
