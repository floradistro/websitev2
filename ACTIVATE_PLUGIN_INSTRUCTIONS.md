# ðŸ”§ ACTIVATE AUTHENTICATION PLUGIN

## âœ… Plugin File Uploaded Successfully

**Location:** `wp-content/plugins/flora-auth-endpoint.php`
**Verified:** File exists on server

---

## ðŸŽ¯ ACTIVATION REQUIRED

The plugin is uploaded but needs to be activated. Here are your options:

---

### Option 1: WordPress Admin (EASIEST)

1. Login to WordPress Admin: `https://api.floradistro.com/wp-admin`
2. Go to: **Plugins** â†’ **Installed Plugins**
3. Find: **"Flora Customer Authentication"**
4. Click: **"Activate"**
5. Done!

---

### Option 2: Database Query

If you have database access (phpMyAdmin or MySQL):

```sql
-- Get current active plugins
SELECT option_value FROM wp_options WHERE option_name = 'active_plugins';

-- Add our plugin to the list
UPDATE wp_options 
SET option_value = 'a:8:{i:0;s:26:"flora-auth-endpoint.php";...}'  
WHERE option_name = 'active_plugins';
```

(You'd need to properly serialize the PHP array)

---

### Option 3: Wait for Auto-Activation

Some WordPress setups auto-activate new plugins. Try the endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.floradistro.com/wp-json/flora-auth/v1/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"test"}'
```

If it returns something other than "No route was found", it's active!

---

## ðŸ§ª AFTER ACTIVATION - Test It

### Test 1: Invalid Credentials
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.floradistro.com/wp-json/flora-auth/v1/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"clistacc2167@gmail.com","password":"wrongpassword"}'

# Should return:
{"code":"invalid_credentials","message":"Invalid email or password","data":{"status":401}}
```

### Test 2: Valid Credentials
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.floradistro.com/wp-json/flora-auth/v1/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"your-real-email@gmail.com","password":"your-real-password"}'

# Should return:
{"success":true,"user":{...customer data...}}
```

---

## âœ… Once Active

Your login system will be secure:
- âœ… Verifies passwords via WordPress
- âœ… Prevents unauthorized access
- âœ… Returns customer data only when authenticated
- âœ… Production-ready

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. Activate the plugin (Option 1 is easiest)
2. Test the endpoint
3. Try logging in on your site
4. Verify it works!

**File is ready, just needs activation!** ðŸ”’
