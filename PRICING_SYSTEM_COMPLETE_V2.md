## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Data Flow (Never Change This):
```
1. vendor_pricing_configs table
   └─ vendor_id: cd2e1122-d511-4edb-be5d-98ef274b4baf
   └─ blueprint: Retail Flower
   └─ pricing_values: { "1g": 14.99, "7g": 69.99, ... }

2. API: /api/page-data/products
   └─ Fetches ALL vendor_pricing_configs
   └─ Builds vendorPricingMap (keyed by vendor_id)
   └─ Applies pricing to ALL products from each vendor

3. Products in API response:
   └─ pricing_tiers: [...] (auto-populated from vendor config)

4. ProductCard component:
   └─ Receives pricingTiers prop
   └─ Shows "Select Quantity" dropdown
   └─ Customer selects tier → Add to cart
```

## 🔒 Critical Files (Protected)

### DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT TESTING:

1. **`app/api/page-data/products/route.ts`**
   - Lines 90-124: Vendor pricing map builder
   - Line 158: Pricing tier application
   - **Rule**: Always apply `vendorPricingMap.get(p.vendor_id)` to ALL products

2. **`components/ProductCard.tsx`**
   - Lines 500-533: Pricing tier selector
   - **Rule**: This is the ONLY ProductCard component - never duplicate

3. **`components/PricingTiers.tsx`**
   - Tier selection UI
   - **Rule**: Don't modify tier structure

---

## ✅ What Works Now:

### Flora Distro Pricing:
```json
{
  "1g": { "price": "14.99", "enabled": true },
  "7g": { "price": "69.99", "enabled": true },
  "14g": { "price": "109.99", "enabled": true },
  "28g": { "price": "199.99", "enabled": true },
  "3_5g": { "price": "39.99", "enabled": false }
}
```

**Result**: 
- 175 Flora products
- ALL show pricing tiers
- 4 enabled tiers appear on cards
- 1 disabled tier (3.5g) is hidden

### Pages Working:
- ✅ http://localhost:3000/products (main Yacht Club)
- ✅ http://localhost:3000/test-storefront/shop (Flora storefront)
- ✅ Individual product pages
- ✅ Both use same API & component

---

## 🧪 Testing (Run Before Deploy)

```bash
# Quick test
node test-pricing-bulletproof.js

# Expected output:
# 🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED - PRICING SYSTEM IS BULLETPROOF! 🎉
# ✅ Safe to deploy
```

If this fails, **DO NOT DEPLOY**. Check:
1. Is dev server running? (`npm run dev`)
2. Did someone modify the protected files?
3. Run: `git diff app/api/page-data/products/route.ts`

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake #1: Creating Duplicate Components
```
DON'T: components/storefront/ProductCard.tsx
USE: components/ProductCard.tsx (only this one)
```

### ❌ Mistake #2: Custom Data Fetching
```
DON'T: Fetch pricing in individual pages
USE: /api/page-data/products endpoint
```

### ❌ Mistake #3: Category Filtering
```
DON'T: if (product.category === 'flower') { apply pricing }
USE: Apply pricing to ALL vendor products
```

### ❌ Mistake #4: Per-Product Configuration
```
DON'T: Require vendors to configure pricing for each product
USE: Configure once → applies to all products
```

## 🎯 How Vendor Pricing Works

### Scenario: Flora Distro wants different pricing for different products

**Option A: Multiple Blueprints (Recommended)**
```
Flora configures:
1. "Retail Flower" pricing (1g, 7g, 14g, 28g)
2. "Edibles Pricing" pricing (1 unit, 5 units, 10 units)
3. "Vape Pricing" pricing (1 cart, 3 carts, 5 carts)

System shows:
- Flower products → Show "Retail Flower" pricing
- Edible products → Show "Edibles Pricing" 
- Vape products → Show "Vape Pricing"
```

**How to implement**:
1. Let vendors create multiple pricing configs
2. Add blueprint selector in vendor dashboard
3. System matches blueprint type to product type
4. **Don't filter in API** - let vendor decide which config applies
