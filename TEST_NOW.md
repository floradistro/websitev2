## ðŸš€ TEST IT NOW

### Step 1: Refresh Browser
Refresh: http://localhost:3000/vendor/storefront-builder

### Step 2: Try a Prompt
Type in chat:
```
"Create a modern homepage with hero section and product grid"
```

### What You'll See:

**Left Panel:** AI response explaining what it built

**Right Panel:** LIVE PREVIEW showing:
- Hero section with vendor name
- Product grid with Flora Distro products
- Navigation menu
- Footer

### Step 3: Keep Building!
```
"Make the hero section have a video background"
"Add a sticky navigation menu"
"Style it like Nike's website"
"Add a product carousel"
```

**Each prompt updates the code and preview!**

## ðŸŽ¨ How It Works

1. You type: "Create a hero section"
2. Claude Sonnet 4.5 writes actual React/TypeScript code
3. Code saved to `storefront_files` table
4. Preview iframe loads from `/api/ai-agent/preview/[id]`
5. Preview builds sandboxed HTML with React
6. Renders your code with real products!
