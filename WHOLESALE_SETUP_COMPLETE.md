## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't see wholesale button
**Solution:** Ensure user is logged in (check localStorage for 'flora-user')

### Issue: Migration fails
**Solution:** Check for existing columns/tables, migration is idempotent

### Issue: Products not showing in wholesale
**Solution:** Verify products have `is_wholesale = true` and `status = 'published'`

### Issue: Application approval not working
**Solution:** Check admin permissions and verify migration created triggers

### Issue: RLS blocking access
**Solution:** Verify user has `is_wholesale_approved = true` in customers table
