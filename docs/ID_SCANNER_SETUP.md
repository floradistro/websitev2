# Quick Setup: Camera ID Scanner

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

Run this migration to add date_of_birth support:

```bash
# Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard
# Copy/paste the SQL from: supabase/migrations/20251029_add_customer_dob.sql

# Option B: Via psql (if you have access)
psql -h [your-supabase-host] -U postgres -d postgres -f supabase/migrations/20251029_add_customer_dob.sql
```

### Step 2: Test the Feature

1. Open your POS in a browser (must be HTTPS or localhost)
2. Go to customer selection
3. Click "Scan ID / License" button
4. Allow camera permissions when prompted
5. Test with a driver license!

## ðŸ§ª Testing Tips

### Test Scenarios

1. **Existing Customer**
   - Scan an ID of someone already in your system
   - Should auto-match and select them
   - Verify their profile shows correct info

2. **New Customer**
   - Scan an ID of someone not in your system
   - Should show new customer form with pre-filled data
   - Review name, DOB, address from ID
   - Add phone/email
   - Create customer

3. **Error Handling**
   - Try scanning with poor lighting
   - Try scanning something that's not an ID
   - Verify error messages are clear

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Camera Won't Open

**Check:**
- Are you on HTTPS? (or localhost)
- Did you click "Allow" for camera?
- Is another app using the camera?
- Browser console for errors

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check browser permissions:
# Chrome: chrome://settings/content/camera
# Safari: Preferences â†’ Websites â†’ Camera
```

### Barcode Won't Scan

**Check:**
- Lighting (needs to be bright)
- Camera focus (hold steady 6-12 inches away)
- Right barcode (back of ID, not front)
- Camera lens clean

**Fix:**
- Add more light
- Clean camera lens
- Hold ID flatter
- Try different angle

### "Invalid barcode data"

This means:
- Not a PDF417 barcode (make sure it's the **back** of the license)
- Or barcode is damaged/unreadable

**Fix:**
- Verify you're scanning the correct barcode
- If damaged, use manual entry ("New Customer" button)

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

### Usage Stats

Monitor your scanner usage:
- Dynamsoft dashboard: https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/account
- Track daily scan count
- Get alerts before hitting limits

### Database Stats

Check customer creation rate:

```sql
-- Customers created via ID scan (have DOB)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM customers
WHERE date_of_birth IS NOT NULL
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Total customer matches today
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM customer_activity
WHERE activity_type = 'profile_update'
  AND created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE;
```

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues

### Issue: "Camera access denied"
**Solution:** Browser settings â†’ Allow camera for your domain

### Issue: Scanner freezes
**Solution:** Refresh page, camera will reinitialize

### Issue: Hit 500 scan limit
**Solution:** Wait 24 hours or upgrade license

### Issue: Poor scan quality
**Solution:** Better lighting + clean lens

## ðŸŽ“ Training Staff

### Quick Training Script

> "We have a new ID scanner! Here's how it works:
>
> 1. Click the blue 'Scan ID / License' button
> 2. Point the camera at the barcode on the BACK of their ID
> 3. Hold it steady for 2-3 seconds
> 4. The system will find their profile or create a new one
> 5. That's it! Much faster than typing everything in."

**Pro tip:** Practice with your own ID first!

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices

1. **Always ask permission** before scanning
2. **Scan the back** of the license (PDF417 barcode)
3. **Good lighting** = faster scans
4. **Hold steady** for 2-3 seconds
5. **Clean camera** regularly
6. **Privacy**: Never store ID images, only data
