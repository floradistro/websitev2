### **About Section** - "Grown with Purpose":
```
At Flora Distro, we believe cannabis cultivation should nurture both body and earth. 
Our small-batch approach allows us to give each plant the individual attention it 
deserves, while our sustainable practices ensure we're leaving the world better than 
we found it.

From organic soil amendments to water conservation techniques, every decision we make 
considers the long-term health of our ecosystem. Because premium cannabis shouldn't 
come at the expense of our planet.
```

### **Newsletter Section**:
```
Premium Products Coming Soon

We're putting the finishing touches on our first harvest of sustainably-grown, 
small-batch cannabis. Our flower, concentrates, and edibles will be available soon.
```

### **Process Section** - "Our Sustainable Process":
```
1. Seed to Soil
We start with premium genetics and organic soil amendments, creating the perfect 
foundation for healthy plant development.

2. Mindful Cultivation
Small batches mean individual attention. We hand-tend each plant, using water-efficient 
irrigation and natural pest management.

3. Careful Harvest
Hand-trimmed and slow-cured to preserve terpenes and potency, then lab-tested to ensure 
purity and consistency.
```

## This is NOT Template Text!

**This is actual professional copywriting** that:
- ‚úÖ Understands Flora Distro's brand (sustainable, small-batch, quality)
- ‚úÖ Uses compelling language ("Artisanal", "nurture both body and earth")
- ‚úÖ Emphasizes their unique selling points (lab testing, sustainability)
- ‚úÖ Handles edge cases (0 products = "Coming Soon")
- ‚úÖ Professional tone (not generic or salesy)
- ‚úÖ Conversion-optimized (builds trust before CTA)

---

## What Was Fixed

### **Bug**: Component prop mismatch
- AI generates: `props: { text: "...", size: "xlarge", alignment: "center", font_weight: "600" }`
- Old component expected: `props: { content: "...", variant: "headline" }`

### **Fix**: Updated Text component to support both formats
```typescript
// Now accepts both:
content?: string;  // Old format
text?: string;      // AI format ‚úÖ

alignment?: string; // AI format ‚úÖ
align?: string;     // Old format

font_weight?: string; // AI format (300, 400, 500, 600) ‚úÖ
weight?: string;      // Old format
```
