## üóëÔ∏è **Why Archived?**

These docs were created during active development of specific features. Now that those features are complete and the system has evolved, these docs serve as historical reference rather than current guidance.

**Current system documentation is in:**
- `/docs/evolution/` - Evolution plan & vision
- `/docs/architecture/` - System architecture
- `/docs/guides/` - How-to guides
