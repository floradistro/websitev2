## 📊 **DATABASE VERIFICATION**

### **POS Transactions Created:**
```sql
3 pickup_fulfillment transactions
All with payment_status: 'completed'
All linked to orders table
```

### **Inventory Changes:**
```
Product: test123 (07d02ba1-bd0b-4bec-a4ec-22661b3bc366)
  Before: 21 units
  After: 16 units
  Deducted: 5 units ✅
```

### **Stock Movements Logged:**
```sql
movement_type: 'pos_sale'
quantity: -5.00
reason: 'Pickup order fulfilled at POS: TEST-CLT-FINAL-...'
✅ Audit trail complete
```

---

## ⚠️ **KNOWN ISSUES (Non-Critical)**

### **1. Schema Inconsistencies:**
- `inventory.product_id` = UUID
- `stock_movements.product_id` = INTEGER (legacy)
- **Fix:** Made nullable, store product_id in metadata instead
- **Future:** Migrate to UUID across all tables

### **2. Reservation Trigger Disabled:**
- `reserve_inventory_on_order_create` trigger disabled
- Reason: Same UUID/INTEGER conflict
- **Impact:** Online orders don't auto-reserve inventory yet
- **Workaround:** Manual reservation or fix schema first

## 📝 **NOTES**

### **Architecture Decision:**
Used same Next.js app with `/pos` routes instead of separate app. Benefits:
- Single codebase
- Shared components & utilities
- Same Supabase connection
- One deployment pipeline
- Route-based code splitting keeps POS lightweight

### **Why Pickup Orders First:**
- Highest immediate value (orders already coming in)
- Simpler than walk-in sales (no payment processing yet)
- Tests full database integration
- Validates real-time sync architecture

### **Database Triggers:**
Inventory deduction happens automatically via database triggers when order status changes to 'fulfilled'. This ensures:
- Atomic operations
- Can't forget to deduct inventory
- Audit trail always created
- Works even if API fails

**Next: Phase 2 (Walk-in Sales) - Build when ready**
