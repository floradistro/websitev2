## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: Products Without Prices
**Severity**: Medium  
**Found**: 4 products (Darkside, Day Drinker, Golden Hour, +1) had no price set  
**Impact**: Would show $0 or null price to customers  
**Fix**: Updated Products API to filter out products without valid prices  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Code Change**:
```typescript
// Before: Only filtered by stock
const inStockProducts = processedProducts.filter((p: any) => 
  parseFloat(p.stock_quantity || 0) > 0
);

// After: Filter by stock AND price
const inStockProducts = processedProducts.filter((p: any) => {
  const hasStock = parseFloat(p.stock_quantity || 0) > 0;
  const hasPrice = p.price && parseFloat(p.price) > 0;
  return hasStock && hasPrice;
});
```

**Verification**:
```
Before Fix: 48 products (4 without prices)
After Fix:  44 products (all with valid prices)
✅ Fixed and verified
```
