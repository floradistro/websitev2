## ⏳ Vercel Deployment

### Current Status:
- Detecting changes
- Building Next.js app
- Running TypeScript checks
- **ETA: 2-3 minutes**

---

## ✅ Localhost Verified Working

I just tested localhost:3000 in browser:

**WhaleTools Homepage:**
- ✅ Header nav (About, API, Partners, Get Started)
- ✅ Hero section with logo
- ✅ Countdown timer (20 seconds, animating)
- ✅ "Complete Infrastructure" section
- ✅ "Not Just Websites" section
- ✅ "What We Build" grid
- ✅ "From Idea To Deployed" with countdown
- ✅ "Ready To Build?" CTA
- ✅ Footer (© 2025 WhaleTools, all links)

**Flora Distro Storefront:**
- ✅ Products loading (Purple Runtz, etc.)
- ✅ Dropdown working
- ✅ All content present

---

## 🎯 When Live Site Updates:

**whaletools.dev will have:**
1. All content (header, footer, countdown)
2. Fixed smart component system
3. Both storefronts working
4. Component editor themed
5. Everything from localhost

---

## ⚠️ If Live Site Still Broken After Deploy:

### Possible Issues:
1. **Cache** - Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **CDN** - Wait 5 minutes for CDN cache clear
3. **Build failed** - Check Vercel logs

### Check Deployment:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Find latest deployment
3. Check build logs
4. Look for "Deployment Complete"

---

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
2. Go to whaletools.dev
3. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Should see all content!

**Deployment in progress...** 🎨✨
