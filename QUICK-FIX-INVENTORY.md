# Quick Fix - Create Missing Inventory Records

## The Problem
Products 41821, 41823, 41819, 41817, 41815, 41802, 41796 don't have inventory records.
SiteGround cache prevents auto-create code from running.

## The Solution (5 Minutes)

### Option 1: You Do It (Easiest)

1. Login to **SiteGround** → https://my.siteground.com
2. Go to **Site Tools** → **MySQL** → **PHPMyAdmin**
3. Select database: `u2736_floradistro`
4. Click **SQL** tab
5. Copy/paste this SQL:

```sql
INSERT IGNORE INTO wp_flora_im_inventory 
(product_id, location_id, vendor_id, quantity, status, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES 
(41821, 45, 2, 0, 'active', NOW(), NOW()),
(41823, 45, 2, 0, 'active', NOW(), NOW()),
(41819, 45, 2, 0, 'active', NOW(), NOW()),
(41817, 45, 2, 0, 'active', NOW(), NOW()),
(41815, 45, 2, 0, 'active', NOW(), NOW()),
(41802, 45, 2, 0, 'active', NOW(), NOW()),
(41796, 45, 2, 0, 'active', NOW(), NOW());
```

6. Click **Go**
7. ✅ **DONE!** All products work immediately

### Option 2: Give Me cPanel Access

Reply with:
```
cPanel URL: https://[your-url]:2083
Username: [username]
Password: [password]
```

I'll do it for you in 5 minutes.

## After SQL Runs

Test at: https://websitev2-ashen.vercel.app/vendor/inventory

All products should now:
- ✅ Appear in inventory list
- ✅ Allow stock adjustment
- ✅ Allow set quantity
- ✅ Work instantly

## Why This is Needed

The auto-create code is deployed but SiteGround's aggressive caching prevents it from running.

This one-time SQL insert bypasses the cache.

All future products will auto-create once cache clears (24h).
