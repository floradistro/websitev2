## üí∞ Cost Tracking (COGS)

### How It Works

**On PO Creation:**
- Unit cost is recorded per product
- Cost is snapshot at time of order

**On Receiving:**
- Inventory unit_cost updated to PO cost
- Average cost calculated using weighted average:
  ```
  New Avg Cost = (Current Qty √ó Current Avg Cost + Received Qty √ó New Cost) / Total Qty
  ```

**Cost Fields in Inventory:**
- `unit_cost`: Most recent purchase cost
- `average_cost`: Weighted average across all purchases

### Example

**Current Inventory:**
- Product: Blue Dream
- Quantity: 100g
- Average Cost: $3.00/g

**New PO:**
- Order: 50g @ $3.50/g

**After Receiving:**
- Quantity: 150g
- Unit Cost: $3.50/g (latest)
- Average Cost: `(100√ó3.00 + 50√ó3.50) / 150 = $3.17/g`
