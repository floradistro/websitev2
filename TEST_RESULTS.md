## Security Test Results

### SQL Injection Protection
- ✅ Parameterized queries prevent injection
- ✅ Special characters in app names handled safely
- ✅ Supabase RLS policies active

### XSS Protection
- ✅ User input sanitized
- ✅ Code blocks parsed safely
- ✅ No script execution from user input

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ RLS policies enforce vendor data isolation
- ✅ API endpoints validate vendor ownership
- ✅ Anon key cannot access other vendors' data

### API Security
- ✅ Invalid tokens rejected (GitHub, Vercel, Anthropic)
- ✅ Rate limiting handled gracefully
- ✅ Malformed requests return proper errors

---

## Performance Metrics

### API Response Times
- GET /api/vendor/apps: < 500ms
- POST /api/vendor/apps: < 2s (without deployment)
- POST /api/vendor/ai-edit: < 5s (depends on AI response)

### Database Performance
- RLS policy overhead: Minimal
- Query performance: Optimized with indexes
- Concurrent operations: Handled correctly

### External API Performance
- GitHub API: < 1s per request
- Vercel API: < 2s per request
- Anthropic API: 3-5s per request

### Deployment Times
- GitHub repo creation: 2-5s
- Vercel initial deployment: 30-60s
- Vercel re-deployment: 10-20s

## Known Issues & Warnings

### Non-Critical Warnings
1. **Invalid UUID handling** - Returns 500 instead of 400
   - Impact: Low (error is still caught)
   - Fix: Add UUID validation middleware

2. **Invalid model test** - Returns 404 instead of 400
   - Impact: None (external API behavior)
   - Fix: Not required

### Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ Duplicate app slugs (database constraint)
- ✅ Very long app names (truncated)
- ✅ Special characters (sanitized)
- ✅ Concurrent requests (serialized)
- ✅ Network failures (graceful error messages)

---

## Environment Validation

### Required Environment Variables
- ✅ `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Valid and working
- ✅ `GITHUB_BOT_TOKEN` - Valid with 4998/5000 requests remaining
- ✅ `GITHUB_ORG` - Set to "floradistro"
- ✅ `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Valid with access to 18 projects
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Configured
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Configured
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Configured

### External Dependencies
