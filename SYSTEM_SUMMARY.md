## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Single Unified Backend (Supabase)

```
inventory table
├── House inventory (vendor_id = NULL)
│   └── At retail/POS locations
└── Vendor inventory (vendor_id = vendor_id)
    └── At vendor locations

Vendors see: ALL inventory at THEIR assigned locations
Result: Unified view of POS + vendor inventory
```

### How It Works

**Vendor Portal**:
1. Vendor has assigned locations (e.g., Warehouse + Retail Store)
2. Query pulls ALL inventory at those locations
3. Shows both vendor's products AND house/POS inventory
4. **ONE inventory system**, not two!

**Admin Portal**:
1. Can see all products across system
2. Can delete any product (with force option)
3. Force delete removes inventory + product
4. Creates audit trail for compliance
