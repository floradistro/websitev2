# üèóÔ∏è Storefront Builder vs Component Editor - Architecture Explained

## You Have TWO Different Systems

### 1. **Component Editor** (`/vendor/component-editor`) 
**Purpose:** Visual page builder for vendor storefronts

**How it works:**
- Database-driven (components stored in `vendor_component_instances`)
- Drag & drop interface
- Edit props visually (text, colors, images)
- Works across **multiple pages** (home, shop, about, footer, etc.)
- Changes saved to database ‚Üí rendered via `ComponentBasedPageRenderer`
- **INCREMENTAL**: Edit existing components, add/remove components
- **PRODUCTION**: This is what vendors use to build their live storefronts

**Pages you can edit:**
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Home (/storefront)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Shop (/storefront/shop)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ About (/storefront/about)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Contact (/storefront/contact)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FAQ (/storefront/faq)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Lab Results (/storefront/lab-results)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Shipping (/storefront/shipping)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Returns (/storefront/returns)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Privacy (/storefront/privacy)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Terms (/storefront/terms)
```

**Technology:**
- iframe-based preview
- postMessage communication
- Database persistence
- Smart Component System (auto-wired props)

### 2. **Storefront Builder** (`/storefront-builder`) - THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE USING
**Purpose:** AI-powered React component code generator/editor

**How it works:**
- Code-based (raw React/TSX components)
- AI generates/modifies code
- Visual preview of generated component
- Works on **SINGLE COMPONENTS** (not full pages)
- Code displayed in editor ‚Üí preview rendered
- **REPLACEMENT**: Each AI generation creates NEW code (can send existing code to modify)
- **DEVELOPMENT**: This is for creating/prototyping custom components

**What it's for:**
- Creating NEW smart components
- Prototyping designs
- Learning/experimenting with AI
- Generating components from screenshots
- Testing design ideas

**Technology:**
- Claude Sonnet AI
- Playwright (screenshot tool)
- React component sandbox
- Exa (design research)

## Your Questions Answered

### ‚ùì "Can I edit the site or does it just spit out completely new code every time?"

**Answer:** It depends which tool you're using:

1. **Component Editor (Production):**
   - ‚úÖ **Incremental editing** - Click a component, edit its props, save
   - ‚úÖ **Persistent progress** - All changes saved to database
   - ‚úÖ **Multi-page** - Edit any page in your storefront
   - ‚úÖ **Live on site** - Changes reflect immediately on public URL

2. **Storefront Builder (Development):**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Replacement by default** - AI generates fresh code each time
   - ‚úÖ **Can modify existing** - Send your current code + prompt (e.g., "change hero color to blue")
   - ‚ùå **Single component only** - Not for full pages
   - ‚ùå **Not saved** - Code exists only in the editor until you deploy it

**How to make Storefront Builder edit incrementally:**
```typescript
// Current code in editor
const code = `export default function Hero() { ... }`;

// Send to AI with modification prompt
AI: "Change the headline to 'Welcome'"
‚Üí AI receives your code + prompt
‚Üí AI modifies the code
‚Üí Returns updated code (preserves structure, only changes headline)
```

This is what `isEditingExisting` flag does - it tells Claude to modify, not replace.

### ‚ùì "How do we edit footer, shop pages, etc?"

**Answer:** Use the **Component Editor**, not Storefront Builder!

**Component Editor:**
```bash
# Access it at:
http://localhost:3000/vendor/component-editor

# 1. Select page from dropdown (footer is on every page)
# 2. Click component in preview
# 3. Edit props in right panel
# 4. Save
```

**How pages work:**
- Each page (home, shop, about) has **sections**
- Each section has **component instances**
- Footer is a component that appears on all pages
- Shop page has product grid components
- About page has about components

**To edit footer specifically:**
1. Go to Component Editor
2. Select any page (footer is global)
3. Scroll to footer in preview
4. Click footer component
5. Edit properties (social links, copyright, etc.)
6. Save ‚Üí Updates on all pages

---

### ‚ùì "How do we make this do the entire site?"

**Answer:** You don't use Storefront Builder for that!

**The RIGHT tool for full site editing:**
```
Component Editor ‚Üí Multi-page, database-driven, visual editor
```

**What Storefront Builder IS good for:**
- Creating a NEW component (e.g., "SmartProductShowcase")
- Testing screenshot analysis (scrape competitor sites)
- Prototyping a complex component before adding to component library
- AI-assisted React coding

**Workflow to add new component to site:**
```
1. Use Storefront Builder ‚Üí Generate component code
2. Test it in preview
3. Copy code ‚Üí Save as new Smart Component (e.g., smart_product_showcase.tsx)
4. Register in component registry
5. Add to database (vendor_component_instances)
6. Now available in Component Editor for all pages
```

| **Storage** | Database | Temporary (in editor) |
| **Interface** | Visual drag & drop | Code + AI chat |
| **Output** | Live website | React component code |
| **Users** | Vendors (non-technical) | Developers/designers |
| **AI** | No | Yes (Claude) |

## Fixing Your Timeout Issue

The 120s timeout you're seeing suggests:

1. **API isn't responding at all** - Let me add better error logging
2. **Stream not starting** - Need to send immediate heartbeat
3. **Silent failure** - Something crashing without error

I'll fix this now by adding comprehensive logging and an immediate response test.

## Recommendation

**For your use case (editing moonwater site):**

If you want to:
- **Build entire pages** ‚Üí Use Component Editor
- **Test AI screenshot scraping** ‚Üí Use Storefront Builder (what you're doing)
- **Create custom components from scratch** ‚Üí Use Storefront Builder
- **Edit existing site content** ‚Üí Use Component Editor

The manual screenshot feature you requested IS in Storefront Builder (for prototyping).
But for production site editing, you'd use the Component Editor.

Let me now fix the timeout issue so you can at least test the screenshot feature! üîß
