## Email Template Files

### Location in WooCommerce Plugin:
```
/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/templates/emails/
```

### Location for Custom Overrides (Theme):
```
/wp-content/themes/YOUR-THEME/woocommerce/emails/
```

### Location in Flora Email Customizer:
```
/wp-content/plugins/flora-email-customizer/templates/emails/
```

---

## Adding More Email Templates

To customize additional emails:

1. Find template in WooCommerce plugin:
   `/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/templates/emails/`

2. Copy to Flora Email Customizer:
   `/wp-content/plugins/flora-email-customizer/templates/emails/`

3. Edit and style to match Flora Distro design

4. Plugin automatically uses custom template

---

## Email Styling Inheritance

**How it works:**

```
ALL WooCommerce Emails
└── Use email-header.php (Flora logo + styling)
└── Use email content (default or custom)
└── Use email-footer.php (Social links + legal)
```

Even emails without custom templates get:
- Flora Distro header
- Flora Distro footer
- Custom CSS styling
- Brand colors
- Logo

Only create custom template if you want to change the email message/content itself.

---

## WordPress vs WooCommerce Emails

### WordPress Core Emails
- Handled by WordPress core
- Use `wp_mail()` function
- Customized via plugin filters
- Plain text by default

### WooCommerce Emails
- Handled by WooCommerce plugin
- Use template files
- HTML by default
- Easier to customize

**Flora Email Customizer handles both types.**

---
