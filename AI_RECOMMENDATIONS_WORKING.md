## 🧠 How It Works

### Step 1: Collect Data
```typescript
- Order history (past purchases)
- Current product (what they're viewing)
- Wishlist items (saved favorites)
- Available products (inventory)
```

### Step 2: Send to Claude
```typescript
POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
Headers:
  x-api-key: sk-ant-api03-g4eyaBYhV...
  anthropic-version: 2023-06-01
Body:
  model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
  prompt: "You are a cannabis expert. Recommend products..."
```

### Step 3: Claude Analyzes
```
Claude reads:
- Customer's purchase patterns
- Current product category
- Product catalog
- Wishlist preferences

Claude thinks:
"They're looking at Blue Razz Edible...
 They might like Fruit Punch (same category)
 And Cherry Limeade (similar flavor profile)"

Claude responds: [707, 786, 798]
```

### Step 4: Return Products
```typescript
- Filter allProducts by Claude's IDs
- Return matched products
- Frontend displays as ProductCards
```

---

## 📊 Fallback System

If Claude API fails (rare):
```typescript
1. Check if currentProduct has category
2. Find products in same category
3. Filter for in-stock only
4. Randomize for variety
5. Return 6 products
6. Flag as "fallback: true"
```

**Result:** Always shows recommendations, even if AI is down!

## 🎯 Where Recommendations Show

### ProductRecommendations Component
Can be added to:
1. ✅ Product pages - "You might also like"
2. ✅ Dashboard overview - "Recommended for you"
3. ✅ Post-checkout - "Customers also bought"
4. ✅ Homepage - "Personalized picks"

**Component:** `components/ProductRecommendations.tsx`

**Usage:**
```tsx
<ProductRecommendations
  currentProduct={product}
  allProducts={products}
  locations={locations}

  inventoryMap={inventoryMap}
  productFieldsMap={productFieldsMap}
