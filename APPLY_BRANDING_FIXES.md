# 🚀 Apply Branding System Fixes

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Removed "Lobster" Font** - No more hardcoded custom fonts on vendors page
2. **Database-Driven Branding** - All vendor branding now loads from database
3. **Fixed Authorization Errors** - Vendor branding and settings pages now work with Supabase auth

## 📝 Step 1: Run Database Migration

You need to add 3 new fields to the `vendors` table in Supabase.

### Option A: Run SQL in Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to: **https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/uaednwpxursknmwdeejn/sql**

2. Copy and paste this SQL:

```sql
-- Add custom_font field for vendor branding
ALTER TABLE public.vendors ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS custom_font TEXT;

-- Add contact fields for vendor settings
ALTER TABLE public.vendors ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS contact_name TEXT;
ALTER TABLE public.vendors ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tax_id TEXT;
```

3. Click **Run** or press `Ctrl+Enter`

4. You should see: `Success. No rows returned`

### Option B: Use the SQL File

The SQL is also saved in: `add-branding-fields.sql`

Just copy the contents and run it in the Supabase SQL Editor.

## 🔄 Step 2: Restart Your Dev Server

```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

---

## ✅ Step 3: Verify Everything Works

### Test 1: Vendors Page
1. Go to: **http://localhost:3000/vendors**
2. ✅ Featured vendor should have clean font (no Lobster)
3. ✅ Vendor cards should have consistent styling

### Test 2: Vendor Branding
1. Login as a vendor
2. Go to: **http://localhost:3000/vendor/branding**
3. ✅ Try uploading a logo - should work without "not authorized" error
4. ✅ Try updating tagline/colors - should save successfully

### Test 3: Vendor Settings
1. Go to: **http://localhost:3000/vendor/settings**
2. ✅ Should load without errors
3. ✅ Try updating contact info - should save successfully

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Column does not exist" error
→ Run the SQL migration in Supabase dashboard

### "Not authorized" when uploading logo
→ Make sure you're logged in as a vendor and the migration has been run

### Logo doesn't display
→ Check Supabase Storage buckets are properly configured

### Still seeing Lobster font
→ Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
