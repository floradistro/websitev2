## 📞 HANDOFF NOTES

### For Future Developers:

**If vendor login breaks:**
1. Check WordPress is up: `curl https://api.floradistro.com/wp-json`
2. Check CORS: `curl -I -H "Origin: ..." https://api.floradistro.com/...`
3. Clear caches: `ssh ... php /home/customer/public_html/clear-opcache.php`

**If product creation fails:**
1. Check browser console for actual response
2. Backend returns JSON even with errors
3. Check database for stuck pending products
4. Clear pending: `DELETE FROM avu_flora_vendor_products WHERE status='pending' AND submitted_date < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)`

**If Vercel build hangs:**
1. Check generateStaticParams (should return [])
2. Check for infinite loops in page components
3. Verify env vars in vercel.json
4. Build locally first: `npm run build`

**If CORS errors:**
1. Check .htaccess has single regex pattern
2. Verify class-ai-cors.php is empty
3. Don't add headers in multiple places
